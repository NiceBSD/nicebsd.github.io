- As important as code is, how we treat each other and behave is *more* important
- We treat each other as friends
- We welcome newcomers with friendliness and respect
- We accept everyone regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, creeds, class, and background
- No one should be made to feel unwelcome
- Rather than see other OS's and distributions as competitors, we see them as examples from which we can learn
